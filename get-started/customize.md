# Overview of Site Content (Home, Directions, Things to Do, Contact)

The website of your vacation rental contains all important information for visitors to be able to learn more about your offering, check availability, book a room and pay for their booking. 

Let's have a quick look at the different pages on your site. 

## Home
The front page tells visitors everything they want to know about your place, like information and photos about the property, rooms and amenities. You can publish a slideshow of images or promotions, and you can also add and update important information like discounts or seasonal events. If visitors like what they see on the front page, they can dig into the content and find out more about your offering.    

Your site comes with a pre-designed template, but **you can edit all content (copy and images)**.

## Directions

The Directions page of your website contains a map that shows the location of your property and (optionally) other places of interest like the airport, restaurants, tourist attractions, etc. 

Pointers are used to show the different locations on the map, the pointer to your property is always differentiated with a distinct colour. You can add pointers to the map or delete them as you see fit. The map scales to show all marked locations, and can be zoomed in for further exploration.

## Things to Do

The Things to Do page lists the activities visitors can choose from. It contains categories for filtering, e.g. visitors can select the 'Gastronomy' category for a list of nearby restaurants. 

Both the list of activities and the list of categories are fully customizable.
